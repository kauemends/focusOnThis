# focuOnThis

 focusOnThis is a simple, minimalist, distraction-free tool that will help you optimize your time and increase your productivity.

 ### Idea

 - Since I used the pomodoro technique for the first time I was impressed, it really helped me increase my productivity. And like every programmer, I thought about creating my own pomodoro.

 ### Design

 - In the design I wanted to do something with an older aesthetic, with colors and fonts that recalled the 60s. I also looked for the idea of minimalism.
